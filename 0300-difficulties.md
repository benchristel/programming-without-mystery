## Test-Driven Development

TDD is not just red-green-refactor. If it were, this book
would be a lot shorter. Rather, I use the term TDD to refer
to a whole suite of practices, mental tools, and techniques
that are enabled and encouraged by the red-green-refactor
cycle.

Some critics of TDD seem to equate it with
red-green-refactor. This conflation is often what leads to
claims like “TDD doesn’t work, and I have a controlled study
to prove it.” What these studies have actually shown is that
the red-green-refactor process by itself doesn’t make a
difference to how good your code ends up.  That’s a very
different claim than “TDD doesn’t work,” and it’s one that
matches my experience perfectly.

Red-green-refactor, by itself, will not improve your work.
Don’t fall prey to the hype. To get any benefit from
TDD, you need to understand all the other things that the
red-green-refactor mindset enables you to do.

Until you’ve seen TDD in action, it’s hard to grok this, and
easy to criticize TDD for its baldfaced ridiculousness. I
once compared TDD to riding a bicycle:

> Can you imagine trying to sell someone a bicycle if they've never seen anyone ride a bicycle before? You can talk till you're blue in the face about gear ratios and brake pads and proper tire inflation, but when your customer gets on the bike they're going to fall off, and then you and they will have words. They will tell you that your contraption is obviously ineffective and probably dangerous. Clearly no one could possibly balance on it, especially not at high speeds. They may concede that one could push along the ground with one's feet while sitting in the saddle— if the pedals were removed. But no way are they buying that bicycle.

When someone says bicycles can’t possibly work, what do you do?

> The sane response to this type of criticism is for the bicycle salesperson to just get on the bike and ride. Once the customer sees someone ride a bike, they will stop insisting that bikes cannot work and start rationally weighing their options.

Often, the thing that convinces people to try TDD is simply
watching an expert practitioner work. When you’ve seen
someone carve clean code out of nothing in a series of
smooth, swift strokes, running the unit tests every five
seconds, it tends to leave an impression. Bob Martin was
convinced to try TDD by two hours of pair programming with
Kent Beck.

Going back to the bike metaphor: red-green-refactor is like
training wheels. It’s the first thing you give someone so
they can get a taste of what TDD is like. But it’s not the
whole picture, not the goal, and not even necessary for an
expert practitioner.

The architect Christopher Alexander, describing his vision
of buildings and towns that arise from human nature itself,
put it this way:

> [T]o become free of all the artificial images of order which distort the nature that is in us, we must first learn a discipline which teaches us the true relationship between ourselves and our surroundings.
>
> Then, once this discipline has done its work, and pricked the bubbles of illusion which we cling to now, we will be ready to give up the discipline, and act as nature does.
>
> This is the timeless way of building: learning the discipline—and shedding it.
