# Case Study 2: A Browser-Based Programming Environment

In this chapter, I'll talk a bit about the principles I
applied to a slightly larger project, Verse—a JavaScript
programming environment contained in a single
HTML file.

One of the things that makes Verse interesting is that it
incorporates a test framework—the idea is that people using
Verse would test-drive their code. It reduces
TDD to the barest essentials, but in a way that results in
delightfully simple, expressive, and extensible tests. One
of the things I hope you get out of this chapter is an
appreciation for how simple TDD can really be.
