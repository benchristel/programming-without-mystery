## Shallow Hierarchies

> [It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of
> physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters
> and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of sentences which
> then cumulate sequentially into paragraphs, rather than the grunts of bullet
> points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it
> didnâ€™t require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.
